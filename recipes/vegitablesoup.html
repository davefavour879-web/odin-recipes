    <p>Vegetable soup is paired with any of the swallows in Nigeria and served as either lunch or dinner. This recipe shows you how to cook a healthy soup with vegetables (ugu and water leaves) the Nigerian way.

I love this soup for many reasons:

For starters, I made it with vegetables, and those are synonymous with health.

In Nigeria, we combine different vegetables to make different soups.
Okra soup, Afang soup and even edikaikong are different combinations of different veggies.

Veggies are good for the heart and body cells.</p>
